<h3>
Version 5.0 - The Rework Update
</h3>

<p>
Version 5.0 is the rework update this update reworks the game entirely
<br>

The update so far has had a major rework to the original game system that changes the price of shares making it way more complex and hard.
<br>

Share prices will randomly jump or crash at random but is most likely to jump when the shares price is under $100 and crash when over $500.
<br>

The Share Start price has also been changed to start between $15 and $70.
<br>

The game proses of saving is changes to a sign in system because there were some problems with the old saving proses when on a server.
<br>

This version also has a better save proses and is more reliable, efficient and secure.
<br>

The orange of buttons was changed to be slightly brighter but nicer
