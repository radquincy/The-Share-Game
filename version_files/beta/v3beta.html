<h3>Experimental 3.2 happy Beta - The happy update</h3>
<p>Experimental 3.2 happy is a Beta Version of a possible later release. This Experimental Version may not have all the features added to the main game.<br>
3.happy adds the Happiness feature to a 3.2 version of the game. The happiness feature is meant to go along with the rent due idea.<br>
This happiness idea is meant to go down by 1 every day but you have ways the can also increase the happiness.<br>
If the happiness is less than or equal to 0 then you will lose the game.<br>
A side bar is added to test if it helps making buttons more accessible and less scrolling is required.<br>
A sell rent amount was added so you could sell a share for the amount of rent is owed.<br>
When hovering over a button it will now change colour. <br>
The buy/sell x10 was removed and replaced with a buy/sell 50%.<br>
