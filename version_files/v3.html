<h3>Version 3.2</h3>
<p>Version 3.2 adds a new price increase or decrease to make the price change in a trend pattern, e.g. if the price had gone up it will contiue for a time.<br>
This version is much harder and makes it more of a prediction then luck game and it definitely makes it more fun and a challenge.<br>
A net worth counter was added to the lose screen to tell you how much you made while playing.
