<h4>
    How to play
</h4>

<p>
Press the "start" button to start the game.<br>
Once the game has started you have to buy and sell shares to make profit and pay for your rent.<br>
If you don't pay for your rent in time you get kicked out of your apartment and lose the game.<br>
You can buy and sell the shares for the same price each "turn" or until the end of the day.<br>
Each Day or "turn [next day]" changes the price of the shares to make you lose or gain money.<br>
The Game is strategy and luck it may take a while to progress far in the game.<br>
